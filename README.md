# Python Billing System 💰

This repository contains a simple billing system written in Python. The project is implemented in two versions:

1. **Without Loop:**  
   - Takes input for three fixed products.
   - Calculates the total and applies a discount based on the amount.

2. **With Loop:**  
   - Asks the user how many items they want to enter.
   - Uses a `for` loop to collect product details and calculate totals dynamically.

## 🔧 Features
- Input item name, price, and quantity
- Calculate individual product totals
- Display itemized billing
- Apply discount based on the total amount:
  - 15% if total > 1000
  - 10% if total > 500
  - No discount otherwise

## 📁 Files
- `billing_without_loop.py` — Version without loop (for 3 fixed products)
- `billing_with_loop.py` — Dynamic version using `for` loop

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Practice `input()`, `if-else`, loops, and arithmetic operations in Python.
- Understand how to apply conditional logic in real-world billing scenarios.
